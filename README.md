## Usage

### Extract Emails:

- The list of extracted emails will appear in the popup.

### Font Size Control:
- You can increase or decrease the font size of the entire email list using the + and - buttons.
- If you select a part of an email and adjust the font size, only the selected portion will change size.

### Email Count:

## Functionality

- **Extract Emails**: Uses a regular expression to scan the page’s text content for email addresses. The found emails are filtered for duplicates and displayed.

- **Copy to Clipboard**: Once the emails are displayed, users can copy all emails to the clipboard in a comma-separated format for easy sharing.

## Files

- **background.js**: Handles background tasks such as extracting email addresses from the webpage.

## Troubleshooting

- **Emails Not Extracted**: If no emails are found, ensure the webpage contains plain text email addresses and not embedded in images or forms.
- **Font Size Not Changing**: If the font size isn't changing, check that you are interacting with the email list and not other parts of the page.
- **Emails Not Copying**: Ensure you are clicking the "Copy Emails" button correctly. If copying still fails, try restarting the extension or Chrome.
